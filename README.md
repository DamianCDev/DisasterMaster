GovHack 2015 Project: Disaster Master


####A final push will be made to this repository just before the conclusion of GovHack 2015.

DisasterMaster is a simple, yet effective way to search for and find past disasters and accidents that have occured in Australia, with in-depth description and statistics about the events, and how to prepare for similar events in the future. We decided to create this app to make information about previous disasters, and how to prepare for them, nire easily accessable and usable to the standard user.
